TESTING --> where to get started = the next time you make a change

# Running tests:
 $ python manage.py test polls 
    => creates a special database for the purpose of testing

# Testing from shell:
>>> from django.test.utils import setup_test_environment
>>> setup_test_environment()

#  django.test.TestCase class provides some additional assertion methods. In these examples, we use assertContains() and assertQuerysetEqual().
