# A view is a “type” of Web page in your Django application that generally serves a specific function and has a specific template.
    => common term for components and actions
# Django will choose a view by examining the URL that’s requested (to be precise, the part of the URL after the domain name).
# To get from a URL to a view, Django uses what are known as ‘URLconfs’. A URLconf maps URL patterns to views.

# Add a few more views to polls/views.py --> these take an argument
# Wire these new views into the polls.urls module by adding the following path() calls
