# Cross Site Request Forgeries --> all POST forms that are targeted at internal URLs should use the {% csrf_token %} template tag
# Always return an HttpResponseRedirect after successfully dealing with POST data. This prevents data from being posted twice if a user hits the Back button.
# reverse() function --> helps avoid having to hardcode a URL in the view function
# two voters voting at the same time --> race conditions -->  Avoiding race conditions using F()

# getting data from the database according to a parameter passed in the URL, loading a template and returning the rendered template --> “generic views” system
    => Convert the URLconf.
    => Delete some of the old, unneeded views.
    => Introduce new views based on Django’s generic views.

    * generic view requires a model attribute
    * DetialView requires pk form url => question_id to pk
    * template_name to use our defined templates instead of default templates of that View
